sqlsynthgen's documentation
=======================================

**sqlsynthgen** is a package for making copies of relational databases and populating them with random data.

.. note::

   This project will be under active development from Jan - Oct 2023


.. note::

   We do not currently support tables without primary keys.
   If you have tables without primary keys, some sqlsynthgen functionality
   may work but vocabulary tables will not.
